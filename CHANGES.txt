(1) Fixed: Changed interpolation for applying deformations in long. batch to 
    trilinear interpolation because b-spline interpolation resulted in neg. 
    values for writing GM/WM maps.
(2) Changed: ROI option is now also available in standard mode because of 
    interferences with long. batch mode.
