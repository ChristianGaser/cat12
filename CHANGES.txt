(1) Weighting for MRF and ORNLM can now be selected in the GUI. This will solve
    some problems with batch files, where changes of these parameters were not 
    considered (thanks to Jose Manjon for pointing to that issue).
(2) VBM8-Manual is also updated to describe the weighting parameters.

(1) Update function now clears the toolbox cache and refreshes function 
    and file system caches.
(2) Reordered some parameter initializations in cg_vbm8_write to save 
    memory.
