Map PET/fMRI to surface atlas:

1. Coregister PET to T1 images
2. Surface Tools -> Map Volume (Native Space) to Induvidual Surface
    Here I would change the sampling function for PET images to "Weighted mean", which uses a weighted average 
    with gaussian kernel for mapping along normals. Otherwise, for fMRI contrast images the default "absmax" is more appropriate.
3. ROI Tools -> Extract ROI-based surface values
   Select the lh.intensity* file from the step above and the Desikan atlas
4. ROI Tools -> Estimate Mean Value inside ROI for external Analysis
    Select the catROIs-file (take care of the additional "s" that indicates the surface ROIs)
