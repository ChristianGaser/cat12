SUIT cerebellar atlas:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The anatomical definitions are based on the fMRI atlas of an individual cerebellum by Schmahmann et al. (2000). To obtain a representative anatomical atlas, the lobules on T1-weighted MRI scans (1mm isotropic resolution) of 20 individual healthy young participants (10 male, 10 female, average age 23.7 yrs) were annotated. The individual cerebella were then aligned using different commonly used normalization algorithms.
