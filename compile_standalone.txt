Steps for compiling
-----------------------------------------
1. Open SPM25
2. Change into folder spm12/config
3. Call spm_make_standalone

Install MCR Runtime
-----------------------------------------
Download MCR with same version of Matlab that you have used for compiling:
http://de.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/

If you have an older version than Matlab R2012a you can also find the MCR 
installer if you call "mcr" at the Matlab prompt. This will point to
the installation file that has to be called as administrator.

Running SPM12 standalone
-----------------------------------------
After compilation there should exist a new folder spm_exec in the same directory 
as spm12.

Call the run_spm12.sh in that folder where the argument is the path to 
your MCR installation (with version number):
./spm_exec/run_spm25.sh /usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v232/

On Linux/Mac, you can edit the Shell script run_spm25.sh to hardcode the 
location of the MCR installation, thus removing the need of providing it on the 
command line.

On Windows systems simply double-click on spm25_wxx.exe.
