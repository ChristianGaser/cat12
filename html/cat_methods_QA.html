      <h2>CAT report and quality control (in development):</h2>
      <p>
        CAT now also prints image quality measurements <a href="#Dahnke:2016">(Dahnke et al. 2016)</a> and major global subjects specific measures in addition to the used preprocessing parameters.
        These data are further saved in the "cat_*.xml" files for each subject that can be read by <a class="function" href="matlab:cat_io_xml">cat_io_xml</a>.  
      </p>
      
      <h3>Image quality measures</h3>
      <p>
        Due to the wide range of rating and marking systems, the rating was defined for a percentage range and a numerical scaling that allows mapping to nominal numbers or letters with chromatic variants ("+" and "-") shown in table below. 
        The obtained quality ratings range from 0.5 (100 rating points (rps)) to 10.5 (0 rps) with values around 1 and 2 describing (very) good image quality (grad A and B) and values around 5 (grad E) and higher (grad F, < 50 rps) indicating problematic images.
        The scaling of the QMs was performed on the basis of theoretical aspects and the analysis of synthetic and real MRI data, especially the BWP (Brain Web Phantom; <a href="#Collins:1998">Collins et al. 1998</a>).
      </p> 
      <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/cat_qa_rating-table.jpg" width=90% height=auto alt="Quality rating" ><p>
      <p>
        The image quality measures describe the properties of the image before CAT12 processing. 
        They were estimated by using the tissue segmentation and were (nearly) independent of subject sex and health status. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>NCR (Noise Contrast Ratio):</h4>
          <p>
            The NCR measures the local standard deviation in the optimized WM segment and is scaled by the minimum tissue contrast.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>ICR  (Inhomogeneity Contrast Ratio):</h4>
          <p>
            The ICR is measured as the global standard deviation within the optimized WM segment and is scaled by the minimum tissue contrast. 
          </p>
        </li> 
        <li>
          <h4>RES (RMS resolution):</h4>
          <p>
            To describe the resolution of an image, the RMS value of the voxel size is used. 
            Outliers with exceptionally low resolutions in one of the <it>x y z</it> dimensions are weighted much stronger than outliers with high resolutions, resulting in an asymmetric penalization. 
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The resulting ratings were combined as weighted average image quality rating <b>IQR</b> <a href="#Dahnke:2016">(Dahnke et al. 2016)</a>. 
        Tests of different databases such as ADNI, IXI, INDI, OASIS, PPMI etc. demonstrated that published data got good quality ratings in general. 
        Please note that <it>excellent</it> rating is defined for extraordinary good images that can be achieved by averaging several ultra high resolution scans on high field systems (e.g. <a href="#Winterburn:2013">Winterburn et al. 2013</a>), 
        and that typical scientific (clinical) data is expected to get just <it>good</it> to <it>satisfactory</it> ratings.

      <p>
        Low image quality can lead to underestimation of the GM in most preprocessings <a href="#Reuter:2015">(Reuter et al. 2015</a>, <a href="#Dahnke:2016">Dahnke et al. 2016)</a>.
        The following figure shows the effect of motion artifacts on IQR and the relative GM volume rGMV of a children dataset processed by 5 different tissue segmentations.

      <h3>Subject measures</h3>
      <p>
        Besides the image quality also the anatomy of a subject influences the result.
        Subjects with average properties have a better chance of a good preprocessing. 
        Subject measures are often part of the analysis an therefore not directly meaningful for quality and preprocessing analysis.
        The measures give only a orientation how average a subject is.
        Untypical values can help to identify a failed preprocessing or untypical subjects within a group, but bad marks do not mean that this dataset should be removed!

      <h3>Result images:</h3>
      <p>CAT result images depending on the export options. The first row displays the intensity normalized, noise and bias corrected T1 image on the left side and the label map p0 on the right. The second row shows the GM (left)  and WM (right) segment. All images where displayed in normalized spaces, if the were available, otherwise the native space is used.<br />Therefore, the figure can contain images of different spaces, so don't  wonder, if the crosshair doesn't show the same structures.</p>
      <p> WARNING: The scaling of the color is normally fixed, but interactive use of the result figure can produce errors. </p>
