        </br>Preprocessing should remain unaffected until the next minor version number. A new processing of your data is not necessary if the minor version number of CAT12 remains unchanged.
      </p>
      <h2>Changes in version CAT12.6-rc1 (1426)</h2>      
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Changes in preprocessing pipeline (which affects your results compared to CAT12.5)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Two main parts of the preprocessing of CAT12 were largely updated: (1) Incorrect estimates of the initial affine registration were found to be critical for all subsequent preprocessing steps and mainly concerned skull-stripping and tissue segmentation. This was a particular problem in brains of older people or children, where the thickness of the skull differs from that of the template. The new estimate of the initial affine registration should now be more robust. In the CAT report the registered contour of the skull and the brain is now overlayed onto the image to allow for easier quality control. (2) Skull-stripping now uses a new approach APRG (adaptive probability region-growing), which should also be more robust. APRG refines the probability maps of the SPM approach by region-growing techniques of the gcut approach with a final surface-based optimization strategy. This is currently the method with the most accurate and reliable results.</li>
            <li>The longitudinal pipeline should now be more sensitive also for detection of effects over longer time periods with VBM (ROI and SBM approaches are not affected by the length of the period). In earlier versions, the average image was used to estimate the spatial registration parameters for all time points. Sometimes this average image was not as accurate if the images of a subject were too different (e.g. due to large ventricular changes). Now, we rather use the average of spatial registration parameters of all time points, which makes the approach more robust for longer periods of time. However, the SPM12 Longitudinal Toolbox can be a good alternative for longer periods of time if you want to analyze your data voxel by voxel.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Important new features</li>
          <ul>
            <li>CAT report now additionally plots the contour of the registered skull and brain onto the image and visualizes skull-stripping. <a class="function" href="matlab:y=cat_surf_results;">Display surface results</a> is largely updated. </li>
          </ul>
        </ul> 
      </p>
      <h2>Changes in version CAT12.5 (1355)</h2>      
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Changes in preprocessing pipeline (which affects your results compared to CAT12.3)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Detection of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) is updated and again enabled by default.</li>
            <li>The default internal interpolation setting is now "Fixed 1 mm" and offers a good trade-off between optimal quality and preprocessing time and memory demands. Standard structural data with a voxel resolution around 1 mm or even data with high in-plane resolution and large slice thickness (e.g. 0.5x0.5x1.5 mm) will benefit from this setting. If you have higher native resolutions the highres option "Fixed 0.8 mm" will sometimes offer slightly better preprocessing quality with an increase of preprocessing time and memory demands.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Important new features</li>
          <ul>
            <li>CAT12 can now deal with lesions that have to be set to zero in your image using the Stroke Lesion Correction (SLC) in expert mode. These lesion areas are not used for segmentation or spatial registration, thus these preprocessing steps should be almost unaffected.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul> 
      </p>
      <h2>Changes in version CAT12.4 (1342)</h2>      
      <p>
        <ul>
            <li>This version had some severe errors in spatial registration which affected all spatially registered data and should not be used anymore.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Changes in version CAT12.3 (1310)</h2>      
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Changes in preprocessing pipeline (which affects your results compared to CAT12.2)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Skull-stripping is again slightly changed and the SPM approach is now used as default. The SPM approach works quite stable for the majority of data. However, in some rare cases parts of GM (i.e. in frontal lobe) might be cut. If this happens the GCUT approach is a good alternative.</li>
            <li>Spatial adaptive non-local mean (SANLM) filter is again called as very first step because noise estimation and de-noising works best for original (non-interpolated) data.</li>
            <li>Detection of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) is currently disabled by default, because of unreliable results for some data.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Important new features</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Cobra atlas has been largely extended and updated.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul> 
      </p>
      <h2>Changes in version CAT12.2 (1290)</h2>      
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Changes in preprocessing pipeline (which affects your results compared to CAT12.1)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Skull-stripping now additionally uses SPM12 segmentations by default: The default gcut approach in CAT12.1 removed too much of the surrounding (extracranial) CSF, which led to a slight underestimation of TIV for atrophied brains. The skull-stripping approach based on the SPM12 segmentations prevents this through a more conservative approach. However, sometimes parts of the meninges (i.e. dura mater) or other non-brain parts still remain in the GM segmentation. By combining both approaches a more reliable skull-stripping is achieved.</li>
            <li>More reliable estimation of TIV: The changed skull-stripping also affects estimation of TIV, which is now more reliable, especially for atrophied brains.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Important new features</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Automatic check for design orthogonality and sample homogeneity using SPM.mat in <a class="function" href="matlab:spm_jobman('interactive','cat_stat_factorial_design.m');">Basic Models</a></li>
            <li>Added equi-volume model by Bok and multi-save option for <a class="function" href="matlab:spm_jobman('interactive','','spm.tools.cat.stools.vol2surf');">mapping native volumes to individual surfaces.</a></li>
            <li>Added <a href="matlab:web('https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/brain_parcellation/Schaefer2018_LocalGlobal','-browser');">Local-Global Intrinsic Functional Connectivity parcellation</a> by Schaefer et al. for resting-state fMRI data.</li>
