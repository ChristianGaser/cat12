      <h2>Changes in version CAT12.7 (1700)</h2>      
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Changes in preprocessing pipeline (which affects your results compared to CAT12.6)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Geodesic shooting registration and surface estimation are now used by default.</li>
            <li>The surface pipeline is largely updated: (1) Parameters for surface reconstruction were optimized. (2) Freesurfer distance method Tfs is now implemented, which is computed as the average of  the closest distances from the pial to the white matter surface and from the white matter to the pial surface. This reduces the occurrence of larger thickness values and results in more reliable thickness measures. For mapping of 3D data the old thickness metric from PBT is more appropriate and is still used.</li>
            <li>An additional longitudinal model is implemented that also takes into account deformations between time points. The use of deformations between the time points makes it possible to estimate and detect larger changes, while subtle effects over shorter periods of time in the range of weeks or a few months can be better detected with the model for small changes.</li>
            <li>Minor changes were made to the segmentation approach to improve accuracy and reliability.</li>
            <li>Internal resampling is now using a new ''optimal'' resolution setting to better support high-resolution data.</li>
            <li>Changed recommendation and defaults for smoothing size to smaller values.</li>
            <li>Renamed template folder for volumes to templates_volumes.</li>
            <li>Atlases installed in spm12/atlas are now called cat12_atlasname.</li>
            <li>The old AAL atlas has been replaced by the AAL3 atlas.</li>
            <li>Cobra atlas is updated because of some previous inconsistencies.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Important new features</li>
          <ul>
            <li>New GUI</li>
            <li>Added older preprocessing pipelines (12.1, 12.3, 12.6) to provide compatible versions to previous preprocessing. These older preprocessing pipelines are available via the <a class="function" href="matlab:spm_jobman('interactive')">SPM batch editor</a (SPM -> Tools -> CAT12) or through expert mode.</li>
            <li>Added simple batch for cross-sectional and longitudinal data that combines several processing steps from preprocessing to smoothing. These batches are available via the <a class="function" href="matlab:spm_jobman('interactive')">SPM batch editor</a (SPM -> Tools -> CAT12) or through expert mode.</li>
            <li>The function <a class="function" href="matlab:y=cat_surf_results;">Display surface results</a> can now also visualize results from VBM analysis and map the 3D volume information onto the surface using an absmax mapping function inside the cortical band. The function is now renamed to ''Surface Overlay''.</li>
            <li>You can call <a class="function" href="matlab:[hReg xSPM SPM] = cat_spm_results_ui('Setup');">Results</a> now from the CAT12 GUI with some new functionality for surfaces and the option to call TFCE results.</li>
            <li>CAT12 now uses Piwik for anonymized CAT12 user statistics (i.e. version information, potential errors). See <a href="cat_statistics.html">CAT12 user statistics</a> for more information. This can be optionally disabled in <a class="function" href="matlab:open cat_defaults;">cat_defaults.m</a>.</li>
            <li>The extraction of ROI-based thickness is not necessary anymore because this is now included in the segmentation pipeline in cat_main.m.</li>
            <li>Changed gifti-format after resampling to use external dat-files. This increases processing speed and prevents the SPM.mat file for surfaces from becoming too large. This can be optionally disabled in <a class="function" href="matlab:open cat_defaults;">cat_defaults.m</a>.</li>
            <li>The use of own atlases for ROI processing is now supported.</li>
            <li>Updated and extended examples for statistical designs and respective contrasts in the CAT12 manual.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul> 
      </p>
      <h2>Changes in version CAT12.6 (1445)</h2>      
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Changes in preprocessing pipeline (which affects your results compared to CAT12.5)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Two main parts of the preprocessing of CAT12 were largely updated: (1) Incorrect estimates of the initial affine registration were found to be critical for all subsequent preprocessing steps and mainly concerned skull-stripping and tissue segmentation. This was a particular problem in the brains of older people or children, where the thickness of the skull differs from that of the template. The new estimate of the initial affine registration should now be more robust. In the CAT report, the registered contour of the skull and the brain is now overlayed onto the image to allow for easier quality control. (2) Skull-stripping now uses a new adaptive probability region-growing (APRG) approach, which should also be more robust. APRG refines the probability maps of the SPM approach by region-growing techniques of the gcut approach with a final surface-based optimization strategy. This is currently the method with the most accurate and reliable results.</li>
            <li>The longitudinal pipeline should now also be more sensitive for the detection of effects over longer time periods with VBM (ROI and SBM approaches are not affected by the length of the period). In earlier versions, the average image was used to estimate the spatial registration parameters for all time points. Sometimes this average image was not as accurate if the images of a subject were too different (e.g. due to large ventricular changes). Now, we rather use the average spatial registration parameters (i.e. deformations) of all time points, which makes the approach more robust for longer periods of time. However, the SPM12 Longitudinal Toolbox can be a good alternative for longer periods of time if you want to analyze your data voxel by voxel. Surface-based preprocessing and also the ROI estimates in CAT12 are not affected by the potentially lower sensitivity to larger changes, as the realigned images are used independently to create cortical surfaces, thickness, or ROI estimates.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Important new features</li>
          <ul>
            <li>CAT report now additionally plots the contour of the registered skull and brain onto the image and visualizes skull-stripping. <a class="function" href="matlab:y=cat_surf_results;">Display surface results</a> is largely updated. </li>
            <li>Parallelization options in CAT12 now enable subsequent batch jobs and are also  supported for longitudinal preprocessing.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul> 
      </p>
      <h2>Changes in version CAT12.5 (1355)</h2>      
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Changes in preprocessing pipeline (which affects your results compared to CAT12.3)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Detection of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) is updated and again enabled by default.</li>
            <li>The default internal interpolation setting is now "Fixed 1 mm" and offers a good trade-off between optimal quality and preprocessing time and memory demands. Standard structural data with a voxel resolution around 1 mm or even data with high in-plane resolution and large slice thickness (e.g. 0.5x0.5x1.5 mm) will benefit from this setting. If you have higher native resolutions the highres option "Fixed 0.8 mm" will sometimes offer slightly better preprocessing quality with an increase of preprocessing time and memory demands.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Important new features</li>
          <ul>
            <li>CAT12 can now deal with lesions that have to be set to zero in your image using the Stroke Lesion Correction (SLC) in expert mode. These lesion areas are not used for segmentation or spatial registration, thus these preprocessing steps should be almost unaffected.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul> 
      </p>
      <h2>Changes in version CAT12.4 (1342)</h2>      
      <p>
        <ul>
            <li>This version had some severe errors in spatial registration which affected all spatially registered data and should not be used anymore.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Changes in version CAT12.3 (1310)</h2>      
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Changes in preprocessing pipeline (which affects your results compared to CAT12.2)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Skull-stripping is again slightly changed and the SPM approach is now used as default. The SPM approach works quite well for the majority of data. However, in some rare cases, parts of GM (i.e. in the frontal lobe) might be cut. If this happens the GCUT approach is a good alternative.</li>
            <li>Spatial adaptive non-local mean (SANLM) filter is again called as a very first step because noise estimation and de-noising works best for original (non-interpolated) data.</li>
            <li>Detection of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) is currently disabled by default, because of unreliable results for some data.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Important new features</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Cobra atlas has been largely extended and updated.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul> 
      </p>
      <h2>Changes in version CAT12.2 (1290)</h2>      
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Changes in preprocessing pipeline (which affects your results compared to CAT12.1)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Skull-stripping now additionally uses SPM12 segmentations by default: The default gcut approach in CAT12.1 removed too much of the surrounding (extracranial) CSF, which led to a slight underestimation of TIV for atrophied brains. The skull-stripping approach based on the SPM12 segmentations prevents this through a more conservative approach. However, sometimes parts of the meninges (i.e. dura mater) or other non-brain parts remain in the GM segmentation. By combining both approaches a more reliable skull-stripping is achieved.</li>
            <li>More reliable estimation of TIV: The changed skull-stripping also affects the estimation of TIV, which is now more reliable, especially for atrophied brains.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Important new features</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Automatic check for design orthogonality and sample homogeneity using SPM.mat in <a class="function" href="matlab:spm_jobman('interactive','cat_stat_factorial_design.m');">Basic Models</a></li>
            <li>Added equi-volume model by Bok and a multi-save option for <a class="function" href="matlab:spm_jobman('interactive','','spm.tools.cat.stools.vol2surf');">mapping native volumes to individual surfaces.</a></li>
            <li>Added <a href="matlab:web('https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/brain_parcellation/Schaefer2018_LocalGlobal','-browser');">Local-Global Intrinsic Functional Connectivity parcellation</a> by Schaefer et al. for resting-state fMRI data.</li>
