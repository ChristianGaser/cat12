The objective is to model the latter by different tissue classes, while modelling the former with a bias field. We know a priori that intensity variations due to MR physics tend to be spatially smooth, whereas those due to different tissue types tend to contain more high frequency information. A more accurate estimate of a bias field can be obtained by including prior knowledge about the distribution of the fields likely to be encountered by the correction algorithm. For example, if it is known that there is little or no intensity non-uniformity, then it would be wise to penalise large values for the intensity non-uniformity parameters. This regularisation can be placed within a Bayesian context, whereby the penalty incurred is the negative logarithm of a prior probability for any particular pattern of non-uniformity.'

In particular, a voxel may not be purely of one tissue type, and instead contain signal from a number of different tissues (partial volume effects). Some partial volume voxels could fall at the interface between different classes, or they may fall in the middle of structures such as the thalamus, which may be considered as being either grey or white matter. Various other image segmentation approaches use additional clusters to model such partial volume effects. These generally assume that a pure tissue class has a Gaussian intensity distribution, whereas intensity distributions for partial volume voxels are broader, falling between the intensities of the pure classes. Unlike these partial volume segmentation approaches, the model adopted here simply assumes that the intensity distribution of each class may not be Gaussian, and assigns belonging probabilities according to these non-Gaussian distributions. Typical numbers of Gaussians could be two for grey matter, two for white matter, two for CSF, three for bone, four for other soft tissues and two for air (background).'

When warping a series of images to match a template, it is inevitable that volumetric differences will be introduced into the warped images.  For example, if one subject''s temporal lobe has half the volume of that of the template, then its volume will be doubled during spatial normalisation. This will also result in a doubling of the voxels labelled grey matter.  In order to remove this confound, the spatially normalised grey matter (or other tissue class) is adjusted by multiplying by its relative volume before and after warping.  If warping results in a region doubling its volume, then the correction will halve the intensity of the tissue label. This whole procedure has the effect of preserving the total amount of grey matter signal in the normalised partitions.  Actually, in this version of SPM the warped data are not scaled by the Jacobian determinants when generating the "modulated" data.  Instead, the original voxels are projected into their new location in the warped images.  This exactly preserves the tissue count, but has the effect of introducing aliasing artifacts - especially if the original data are at a lower resolution than the warped images.  Smoothing should reduce this artifact though.'

It requires the images to be spatially normalised, segmented into different tissue classes, and smoothed, prior to performing statistical tests/* \cite{wright_vbm,am_vbmreview,ashburner00b,john_should}*/. The "optimised" pre-processing strategy involved spatially normalising subjects'' brain images to a standard space, by matching grey matter in these images, to a grey matter reference.  The historical motivation behind this approach was to reduce the confounding effects of non-brain (e.g. scalp) structural variability on the registration. Tissue classification in older versions of SPM required the images to be registered with tissue probability maps. After registration, these maps represented the prior probability of different tissue classes being found at each location in an image.  Bayes rule can then be used to combine these priors with tissue type probabilities derived from voxel intensities, to provide the posterior probability.'

                    'This procedure was inherently circular, because the registration required an initial tissue classification, and the tissue classification requires an initial registration.  This circularity is resolved here by combining both components into a single generative model. This model also includes parameters that account for image intensity non-uniformity. Estimating the model parameters (for a maximum a posteriori solution) involves alternating among classification, bias correction and registration steps. This approach provides better results than simple serial applications of each component.'
