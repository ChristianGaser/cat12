Anatomy atlas:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Combining probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps and functional imaging data.

VBM12 was used to segment the T1 data (Collins brain) and to estimate the 
normalization parameter to project the probability maps each cytoarchitectonic 
regions of Simon Eickhoffs Anatomy Toolbox (A) to IXI550 space. 
A 3D median filter was used to remove outliers in the label map. ROI-IDs 
were reseted to guaranty that left side ROIs were described by odd numbers, 
whereas right-hand side ROIs only have even numbers. ROIs without side-alignment 
in the original atlas like the brainstem were broken into a right and left part.
Therefore, a Laplace filter was used to estimate the potential field of unaligned
regions between the left an right potential. If most or no side alignment in the
original map was available, a side label map from the anatomy toolbox of SPM was
used.

Please have also a look for the anatomy toolbox of Simon Eickhoff (Version 1.8, 
2011-05-02) that provide the data.
