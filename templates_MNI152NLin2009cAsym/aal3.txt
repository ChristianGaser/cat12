AAL (AUTOMATED ANATOMICAL LABELING) atlas:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAT12 was used to segment T1 data (Collins brain) and to estimate the normalization parameters to transform the maximum probability maps to MNI152NLin2009cAsym space.

AAL3 User Guide

The automated anatomical parcellation AAL3 of the spatially normalized single-
subject high-resolution T1 volume provided by the Montreal Neurological Institute 
(MNI). This includes the original parcellation provided in AAL (Tzourio-Mazoyer 
et al 2002), the new parcellation of the orbitofrontal cortex provided in AAL2 
(Rolls, Joliot, and Tzourio-Mazoyer, 2015) , but also new areas, as described in 
this User Guide and by (Rolls et al., 2019).

User guide

Following a first version AAL of the automated anatomical labeling atlas 
(Tzourio-Mazoyer et al 2002), a second version (AAL2) (Rolls, Joliot, and 
Tzourio-Mazoyer, 2015) was developed that provided an alternative parcellation 
of the orbitofrontal cortex following the description provided by Chiavaras, 
Petrides, and colleagues.  We now provide a third version, AAL3, which adds a 
number of brain areas not previously defined, but of interest in many neuroimaging 
investigations. The new areas in the third version are subdivision of the anterior 
cingulate cortex into subgenual, pregenual and supracallosal parts; the thalamus; 
the nucleus accumbens, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, red nucleus, 
locus coeruleus, and raphe nuclei. The new atlas is available as a toolbox for 
SPM, and can be used with MRIcron.
