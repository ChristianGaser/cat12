Hypothalamus atlas:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
High-resolution in vivo anatomical atlas of the human hypothalamic region. A minimum deformation averaging (MDA) pipeline was employed to produce a normalized, high-resolution template from multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets. This template was used to delineate hypothalamic (n = 13) and extrahypothalamic (n = 12) gray and white matter structures. 

The atlas is cropped and side alignment was adapted.
