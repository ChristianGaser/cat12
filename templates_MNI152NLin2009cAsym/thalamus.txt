Thalamus atlas:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This atlas is based on the atlas of human thalamic nuclei of Version 1.0 2018-05. 

CAT12 was used to estimate the normalization parameters to transform the maximum probability map to MNI152NLin2009cAsym space. 

If you use this atlas, please cite the references below.

We provide NifTI-1 files representing a digital atlas of seven thalamic subparts per hemisphere. More precisely, the files include the spatial probabilistic atlas maps for each thalamic subpart (Thalamus_Nuclei-HCP-4DSPAMs.nii.gz) and the maximum likelihood atlas (Thalamus_Nuclei-HCP-MaxProb.nii.gz) in MNI space. The region corresponding to each labeled thalamic part respectively is given in the look-up table Thalamic_Nuclei-ColorLUT.txt.
The NIFTI files can be visualised with the main available tools such as tkmedit, freeview or 3D-Slicer.

We also provide a step by step pseudo code for creating the atlas.


—————————
The atlas was build from a subset of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database (https://db.humanconnectome.org). The IDs, age and gender of the HCP subjects whose images were used for the atlas construction are given in Description_HCPdata.txt.
The used HCP data is provided by the Human Connectome Project, WU-Minn Consortium (Principal Investigators: David Van Essen and Kamil Ugurbil; 1U54MH091657) funded by the 16 NIH Institutes and Centers that support the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research; and by the McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University.
