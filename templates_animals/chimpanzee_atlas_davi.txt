Juna.Chimp & Davi Parcellation v0.3 (23.10.2020)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hand-drawn macroanatomical pracellation of major grey matter regions within the
chimpanzee brain.

CAT12 was used to create the Juna.Chimp mean T1 template from 220 chimpanzees provided 
by the National Chimpanzee Brain Resource (NCBR, http://www.chimpanzeebrain.org/). 
The manual delineation of the 130 macroanatomical regions was performed using 3D Slicer
(https://www.slicer.org) by Sam Vickery & Robert Dahnke. Left-sided brain regions are labeled
by odd numbers, whereas right-hand side ROI's have even numbers. Their location were determined
based on major gyri and sulci features of the cerebral cortex, as well as distinct anatomical 
landmarks of basal ganglia and cerebellar cortex. The border between two gyri was set at the 
mid-point of the connecting sulcus and Large gyri were sub-divided based on available gross 
anatomical features such as gyral/sulcal folds, continuation of sulci, and size.

To call the Juna.Chimp templates directly from cat12, first, the contents of this directory
needs to be placed in the templates_animals directory (~\spm12\toolbox\cat12\templates_animals).
If such a directory doesn't exist then create it. Second, call the chimpanzee specific batch 
with cat12('chimpanzee').
