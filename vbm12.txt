%
% Segmentation:
%
% This toolbox is an extension of the default segmentation in SPM12, but 
% uses a completely different segmentation approach.  
% 
% 1. The segmentation approach is based on an adaptive Maximum A Posterior 
% (MAP) technique without the need for a priori information about tissue 
% probabilities. That is, the Tissue Probability Maps are not used constantly 
% in the sense of the classical unified segmentation approach, but just for 
% spatial normalization. The following MAP estimation is adaptive in the 
% sense that local variations of the parameters (i.e., means and variance) 
% are modelled as slowly varying spatial functions (Rajapakse et al. 1997). 
% This not only accounts for intensity inhomogeneities but also for other 
% local variations of intensity.
% 
% 2. Additionally, the segmentation approach uses a Partial Volume Estimation 
% (PVE) with a simplified mixed model of at most two tissue types 
% (Tohka et al. 2004). We start with an initial segmentation into three pure 
% classes: gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
% based on the above described MAP estimation. The initial segmentation is 
% followed by a PVE of two additional mixed classes: GM-WM and GM-CSF. This 
% results in an estimation of the amount (or fraction) of each pure tissue 
% type present in every voxel (as single voxels - given by their size - 
% probably contain more than one tissue type) and thus provides a more 
% accurate segmentation.
%
% 3. Furthermore, we apply two denoising methods. The first method is an 
% optimized block-wise non-local means (NLM) denoising filter 
% (Coupe et al. 2008). This filter will remove noise while preserving edges 
% and is implemented as preprocessing step. The second method is a classical 
% Markov Random Field (MRF) approach, which incorporates spatial prior 
% information of adjacent voxels into the segmentation estimation 
% (Rajapakse et al. 1997).
%
% 4. Another important extension to the SPM12 segmentation is the integration 
% of the Dartel normalisation (Ashburner 2007) into the toolbox. If high-
% dimensional spatial normalisation is chosen, an already existing Dartel 
% template in MNI space will be used. This template was derived from 550 healthy 
% control subjects of the IXI-database (http://www.brain-development.org) 
% and is provided in MNI space  for six different iteration steps of Dartel 
% normalisation. Thus, for the majority of studies the creation of 
% sample-specific Dartel templates is not necessary anymore.

%
% Cortical Thickness Estimation:
%
% Further extensions to SPM12 are the estimation of cortical thickness maps
% (Dahnke et al. 2012) and of cortical atlas maps with major brain structures
% that is used to restrict thickness estimation to cortical areas.
% You can use the thickness phantom (http://...)
% directly in the VBM pipeline, although it was constructed as p0 image. But  
% be warned, the estimated thickness will vary a little bit from the value 
% in the paper, because it is now influenced by all preprocessing routines!

%
% VBM Report and Quality Control:
%
% Besides the used preprocessing parameters VBM now also print image quality
% measurements and global subject measurements. All measurements were graded
% (1 - very good, 2 - good, 3 - acceptable, 4 - marginal, 5< - problematic).
% Measures and/or grading are under development and should help to identify 
% problematic datasets. 
% All graded measurements were done for the original image and if useful for  
% the corrected image (original > corrected). Bracketed values represent the
% non-graded measurement. 
% Although, the preprocessing routines try to correct problems like noise or 
% bias, stronger aberrations require stronger corrections that reduce spacial 
% resolution or maybe fail.
% Their are 
%
% 1) Image Quality Measures:
%  Noise (tissue noise):
%   Noise is measured as the local standard deviation in the WM segment and 
%   scaled by the signal intensity that is in our case given by the GM-WM 
%   contrast. The WM is used rather than the background, because the back-
%   ground can be removed or it contains/not contain artifacts outside our
%   regions of interest. 
%
%  Bias/Inhomogeneity:
%   Inhomogeneity is measured as the global standard deviation in the WM 
%   segment. Only the WM segment is used because the GM is strongly effected 
%   by the PVE (boundary voxel between tissues) and has varying intensities
%   like in the basal ganglia, the motor cortex or the occipital lobe. 
%
%  Contrast (GM-WM contrast):
%   Most important for the image segmentation is the GM-WM contrast. If the 
%   contrast is to low initial segmentation/registration/bias correction will 
%   be difficult. 
%   ...
%
%  Voxel Volume & Isotropy:
%   The image resolution play an important rule, especially if you want to 
%   measure cortical thickness. 
%   ...
%
%  Preprocessing Change Map:
%   ...
%
%
% 2) Subject Averageness:
%  CGW-Volumes: 
%   Absolute and relative volume of the major tissue classes for all brain
%   structures. 
%
%  TIV:
%   Total Intracranial Volume as the sum of all tissue classes within the 
%   brain mask.
%
%  Tissue Expectation Map:
%   VBM uses prior maps only for initial purposes. This allows to estimate 
%   a map that describes how well a subject fits to the prior maps. It is #
%   expected that subject that are close to the average case are easyer to
%   handle for most preprocessing routines for a similar image quality.
%
%  [Cortical thickness:]
%   Mean cortical thickness and its standard deviation. 
%   Only available, if cortical thickness is processed.
% 
%
% Result images:
%  VBM result images depending on the export options. The first row displays
%  the intensity normalized, noise and bias corrected T1 image on the left
%  side and the label map p0 on the right. The second row shows the GM (left)
%  and WM (right) segment. All images where displayed in normalized spaces, 
%  if the were available, otherwise the native space is used. 
%  Therefore, the figure can contain images of different spaces, so don't 
%  wonder, if the crosshair doesn't show the same structures.
%  
%  WARNING: The scaling of the color is normally fixed, but interactive use 
%           of the result figure can produce errors.
